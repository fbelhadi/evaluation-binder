### How to use this notebook

This notebook contains many cells, which can be either Markdown (for narrative content and instructions) or Code.

You can enter the Markdown cells in edit-mode by double-clicking on the cell. To return it to display mode, you must *run* it by clicking the <kbd>â–¶</kbd> icon in the notebook menu, or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Code cells can be edited directly, and the code will be executed when run. Note that all cells share the same "session", so for example, a variable assigned in one cell is available for use in following cells. Review the <kbd><kbd>Run</kbd></kbd> menu to see other options. In particular, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> is useful for stepping through a notebook, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> is useful for continuing your work in a new cell.

Each cell (including code output) can be collapsed individually by clicking on the color-bar at the left side of the cell. When prompted, you may click on the <kbd>...</kbd> button to expand them.
